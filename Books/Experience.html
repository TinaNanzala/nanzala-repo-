<h1>THE INTERVIEW</h1>
</div>
<div class="content">

<p>My heart is pounding.The elevator arrives on the first floor and i scramble out as soon as the door slides open.Stambling once,but fortunately not sprawling on to the immaculate sandstone floor.I race for the wide glass doors and i'm free in the bracing , cleansing dump air of Zambia.Raising my face i welcome the cool refreshing air.</p>
I still remember my interviewer and the interview questions we asked each other, Mr Roman whom i have heard about alot and what he likes and dislikes ,i felt like i knew my interviewer already but the only that i hadn't seen him another thing i didt know was that, even though I had gone for that job interview, his interest was to find a blonde,slender young girl who'd be fit for the position I had gone to apply for which was a front office manager.I was so sure I wouldn't make it but i just went for the interview let me just say it was for fun I had no anticipations for my self, knockig on the clear glass door on mr Roman's office door "Come in," looking at me like he has never see  anyone like me before,"have a seat,"He says.
<p>"Now tell me about yourself,"I dislike this question so much , i gaze back at him and i hardly answer that question instead I ask him a question "You're very young to have amassed such an empire.To what do you owe your success?"I glance up at him.His smile is rueful but he looks disappointed."Miss Business is all about how hard you push yourself and how you relate and judge people"He responds.</p>
<p>Mr Roman looks at me with lots of questions on his mind, i could tell he wasn't happy,"So what do you do on your free time?do you go out with friends?do you just stay at home ?and whybare you such a querrysome person I thought you came to be interviewed?"He said these questions did not seem so interesting to even respond to, but who was i not to respond,I responded to all of them and also added some more information</p>
<p>I am miss Tina, twenty two years ,a graduate from Zambia University, i like to go out with my friends,i enjoy socializing with people and Yes i am a very cusious person too i like to ask may questions"Mr Roman looking so surprided,looks at me with his dazzling eyes,he rubs along his chin with his long fingers,this somehow moves me.I look at him ,and he holds my gaze steadily,impassive.My heartbeat quickens,and my face flushes again.</p>
<p>Why does he have such an unnerving effect on me,is it his good-looks maybe,the way he rubs his index fingers on his lower-lip,his deep voice while he talks,"I like to employ people who are smart and serious,but i like you, the fact that you are not shy, you are cusious i am in love with it."He says"You seem so interesting to be with" he adds.My heartbeat increases in pulse i feeel so scared and somehow blushy.</p>
<p>"Waaahh this interview, it's one of the best" thinking to myself.This interviewer Mr Roman made me feel so great infact no man has ever affected me the way Roman did, i cannot tell why.Is it his looks?His heart which i do not even know whether he is that good.Wondering why i found him interesting,as the interview ends"I will call you tonight, will you beavailable for a business dinner date?"he asks,hesitantly"Sir....yes i will be"Let us meet at six o'clock,he says,I stand up and take a leave with a smile on my face but mr Roman doesn't notice it.Still standing outside the wide glass doors of the office a taxi arrives and i leave for my home back in Lusaka,but as time goes on this interview process becomes the beginning of my current relationship and career.</p>
