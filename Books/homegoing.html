  </div>
   <body>
<div class="main-container">         
<p>In the book women are subjected to harsh working conditions and physical degradation<br/>
<br/>Women’s fate is controlled by the men, they are often sexually violated.<br/>
<br/>They are raped in the dungeons, this is shown by <strong>Esi </strong> who is raped by the white man and it is also shown in the novel by <strong>Maame</strong>,<strong> Effia </strong>and <strong>Esi’s</strong> mother who is also raped as a maid raped.<br/>
<br/>Women also have no right to say anything, this is shown when <strong>Effia</strong> realizes there were slaves being kept in the dungeon, she tries to tell James but, he shuts her.<br/>
<br/>Women are again discriminated against their burnt scars, <strong>(Akua and Yaw)</strong><br/>
<br/>Women are also unable to find jobs, due to their gender.<br/>
<br/>Women are starved, abused and their babies taken away, this is shown by the breastfeeding woman whose baby was taken away in the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>Women are also forced into marriage and have no father figures <strong>(Effia, Esi)</strong><br/>
<br/>Women are loved, this is shown by <strong>Effia</strong> who is loved by <strong>James</strong>,<strong> Ness </strong>who is loved by <strong>Sam</strong>,<strong> Esi</strong>who is loved by<strong> Big man.</strong><br/>
<br/>Women are still treated as slaves, even though live with husbands who are leaders, this is shown by <strong>Maame </strong>who is follows what Big man believes. 
Role of women,<br/>
<br/>Women are depicted as strong, they are able to endure the mistreatment 
<br/>Women were supposed to watch over the children and cook for their husbands,<br/>
<br/>Women were expected to give birth; hence <strong>Effia’s</strong> lineage depended on motherhood and marriage to better their lives <br/>
<br/>Women play the role of loving the people in their lives,<strong> Maame</strong> depicts this by, giving <strong>Esi</strong> the Blackstone and asking her to run and hide 
<br/><strong>Esi</strong> also loves <strong>Abronoma </strong>by treating her better than her father,<strong> Big Man</strong>,<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Treatment of women Today</h2><br/>
<br/>Women in the present day are treated with respect,<br/>
<br/>Women have a right hence are not forced into marriage.<br/>
<br/>Women in this era are appreciated and not discriminated against and their achievements are also noticed.<br/>
<br/>Women in the present age receive ethical treatment, they are valued and hence their dignity is not robbed from them. <br/>

<h3>Role of Women Today</h3>

<br/>In the era that we live in things have certainly changed, improved for women, but still at the top of the faces remain stubbornly the male.<br/>
<br/>They have been huge chances for women in terms of employment, women are not defined by gender so as to get the job.<br/>
<br/>Still at the government the faces remain male, men are the ones who are believed to lead.<br/>
<br/>Today, women are believed to be the key to sustainable development and quality of life in the family.<br/>
<br/>Women love and care for family, their children, husbands and also friends</p><br/>
